# Real-time-Ethereum-Analysis

## Introduction: 

* The use of digital currencies has increased dramatically in recent years, which has caused an explosion in the volume of transactions on blockchain networks.

* Blockchain data management, analysis, and insight-gathering can be greatly aided by the application of big data engineering methodologies.

* These methods can be useful for handling and evaluating massive amounts of data.

## Goal: 
* By storing only the analytics rather than the complete data in a database, it will be less expensive to retain the vast amounts of data and enable real-time analysis of Ethereum transactions.

* Absorbing Big Data and generating insight from the stream of real-time data.

* Creating cumulative analytics data will help the data take up less storage space.

## Architecture of the Data Pipeline:

* Service 1: Analysis and Streaming of Data First Service

* Service 2: Real-time data retrieval and analysis is the second service. 

## TestBeds Volume Outcome: Since these are real-time Ethereum transactions, there is a large amount of data.

* **Velocity**: Due to the constant flow of transactions via the Ethereum blockchain, data generation is occurring at a high speed.

* **Variety**: Spark is used to process unstructured data that is received.

* **Availability**: The data analysis could be retrieved in real-time and shown on the Flask front end thanks to its storage in an SQL database.

## In summary
* In this project, an analysis of Ethereum transaction data was conducted using PySpark and a number of data visualization tools. The image was run locally on any device using a docker container.

* The data analysis produced a number of intriguing conclusions, such as:

* The most popular payment methods, the busiest hours of the day for transactions, the top senders in terms of the volume of transactions, and the total amount of Ethereum transmitted for the whole duration.

All things considered, this effort makes a significant addition to the expanding field of blockchain analytics.
